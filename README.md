# MonoGame.WpfCore

MonoGame embedded inside a WPF app as a `dotnet new` template.

## Prerequisites

This template uses .NET Core 6. If you're having trouble getting it to compile make sure you've updated to the latest version. I have confirmed that it works with:

 - Visual Studio 2022 or later.
 - [.NET Core 6.0.422](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0) which should install with Visual Studio anyway.
 - The MonoGame NuGet packages are not .NET Core compatible, so you'll also need .NET Framework 4.7.2 installed.

## Installing the template

To install the `dotnet new` template, clone this repository locally and [install the template from a local directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates#to-install-a-template-from-a-file-system-directory).

```
dotnet new install MonoGame.WpfCore
```

After the template is installed you should see it in the list. To create a new project, first create an empty directory then run the template.

```
mkdir MyLevelEditor
cd MyLevelEditor
dotnet new monogamewpf
```

All done! Open the solution and run the project.

## Simple.

There's no magic here.

 - The WPF project references the official [`MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX/). The same package can be used in your game.
 - There's only a handful of files required to do the heavy lifting.
 - The `MonoGameContentControl` is a standard WPF control in every other way.

## Modern.

I've been using and refining the `MonoGameContentControl` in my own projects for many years. Everything else in this template was built from the ground up using the latest .NET technologies.

 - Thanks to the new `UseWPF` flag introduced in .NET Core 3.0 we can build WPF projects in the new `csproj` format.
 
## Customizable.

All of the code used to embed MonoGame in WPF is included in this template. You can edit and customize it however you like.

 - The template includes a `MonoGameViewModel` as an example of how to get started. If you use a different view model architecture, just change it.
 - The project references the `MonoGame.Content.Builder.Task` package so that it can automatically build your `Content.mgcb` file. You can load content using the `Content` manager just like you do in your games. If your editor doesn't need this you can simply remove it and the .config\dotnet-tools.json file.
